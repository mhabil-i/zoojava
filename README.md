# Zoo Database System

Hello, I am Habil. I am currently learning Java, and this is one of my beginner projects: a simple Zoo Database System.

## Project Description

This Java project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. It simulates a zoo environment with various animals and their behaviors.

To start the program, run:

```bash
AnimalDisplay.java
```

## Features

    Abstract class for base Animal

    Subclasses for specific oragnism types (Plant, animal)

    Each animal displays unique information and behaviors

    Simple console-based interface

## Topics Covered

    Classes & Objects

    Inheritance & Polymorphism

    Abstract Classes

    Method Overriding

    Java Collections

    Basic Console I/O

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to add:

    File saving/loading support (File I/O)

    Feeding and medical tracking system

    Zoo employee management

    GUI using JavaFX or Swing

    Unit testing using JUnit
